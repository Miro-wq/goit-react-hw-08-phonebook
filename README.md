### Description 

This homework task is a simple contact management application for a phonebook, designed to practice fundamental React concepts and state management. The application allows users to add, display, search, and delete contacts, with each contact consisting of a name and a phone number. The project is structured to progressively introduce new features, demonstrating the importance of component-based architecture, controlled components, and state handling in React.

### Key Features 

1. **Add Contacts**: Users can add contacts with a name and phone number. The application ensures that contact names adhere to a specific pattern and prevents the addition of duplicate names.
  
2. **Search and Filter**: A search field is provided to filter contacts by name, with case-insensitive matching.

3. **Contact List Management**: Users can view a list of all contacts and remove any contact they no longer need.

4. **Component Refactoring**: The application is refactored from a single component into multiple independent components, enhancing modularity and readability.

### Key Learning Objectives:

- **State Management**: Manage and update state in React, particularly how to structure state to store multiple properties and handle user inputs in a controlled manner.

- **Componentization**: The importance of breaking down an application into smaller, reusable components became evident. This approach not only simplifies development but also makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale.

- **Form Handling**: Experience in handling forms in React, including managing controlled inputs and validating user data through patterns and required fields.

- **Conditional Rendering**: Implementing conditional logic to prevent duplicate contacts from being added, which reinforced the concept of controlling what gets rendered based on the application's state.

- **Refactoring and Code Organization**: Refactoring the application into separate components taught me the significance of organizing code in a way that promotes reusability and separation of concerns.

- **User Experience Considerations**: Enhancing the user experience by providing feedback (such as alerts) and ensuring the interface remains responsive and intuitive.

This project served as a solid foundation for building more complex React applications, emphasizing the core principles of React and good development practices.

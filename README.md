>The project is the final part of code refactoring for the phonebook application with user authentication, showcasing advanced React concepts such as state management, form handling, and integration with a backend for user registration, login, and data persistence.

![Features](https://img.shields.io/badge/Features-purple?style=for-the-badge)

- **User Authentication:** Supports user registration, login, and logout functionality.
- **Personalized Phonebook:** Users can securely add, edit, and delete their contacts.
- **Form Validation:** Ensures proper input for creating and editing contacts.
- **Persistent Data:** Contacts are stored and retrieved from a backend service.
- **Routing:** Implements private and public routes for authenticated and unauthenticated users.

- **State Management**: Manage and update state in React, particularly how to structure state to store multiple properties and handle user inputs in a controlled manner.
- **Componentization**: The importance of breaking down an application into smaller, reusable components became evident. This approach not only simplifies development but also makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
- **Form Handling**: Experience in handling forms in React, including managing controlled inputs and validating user data through patterns and required fields.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implementing conditional logic to prevent duplicate contacts from being added, which reinforced the concept of controlling what gets rendered based on the application's state.
- **Refactoring and Code Organization**: Refactoring the application into separate components taught me the significance of organizing code in a way that promotes reusability and separation of concerns.
- **User Experience Considerations**: Enhancing the user experience by providing feedback (such as alerts) and ensuring the interface remains responsive and intuitive.
